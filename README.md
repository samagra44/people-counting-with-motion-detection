# pedestrian counting with motion detection
In this Repository, I use just the OpenCV library with general libraries such as random, NumPy, and time to detect any movement within the video or live feed. 

The basic idea of this project is to find movement in the video so, it's also useful as motion detection. it also collects information in the log file which gives information about when pedestrians cross the line and where he/she goes.
